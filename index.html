<h1>Dancing</h1>
<h3>Moving with the rythm</h3>
<p>Myfirst dancing practice was embarrisisng because I felt in front of the whole class and everyone laugh at me. But stood up and try it again and did it better than the last time.</p>
<h3>My first good day</h3>
<p>Next day in class I showed the class some steps that I have created for the song that we had to dance and like it. And I was happy because they decided to use my dance steps for the song.</p>
<p>We will make a break here.<br> A break can be used anywhere. It is a line break.</p>
